# Kinship-Detector
Kaggle Challenge on FIW Dataset
This was the project I and three others created as a capstone project at IIT-Hyderabad under the supervision of Ms.Nazil Parveen.

The we are supposed to accurately detect if the 2 images are similar to each other such that a kinship could be proved between the two.
(Eg: Father-Son, Mother-Son count as related entities, but Husband-Wife do not)

We have used a Siamese One-Shot learning method, and used VGG-Face to extract important features.The final reult is derived on the basis on cosine similarity of the features.
